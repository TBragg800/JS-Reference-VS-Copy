    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team =  players;

    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
      // team[3] = "Lux";

    // however what happens when we update that array?
      //we update the original array as well team which was a reference to the original array.

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;

    console.log(person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 109, age: 12 });
    console.log(captain2);
    console.log("person", person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const captain3 = {...person};
    console.log(captain3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const thomas = {
      name: "Thomas",
      age: 37,
      social: {
        twitter: "@tbb",
        facebook: "thomas.developer"
      }
    }

    console.log(thomas);

    //copy of object
    const dev = Object.assign({}, thomas);

    //poor man's object copy/ first the entire object is turned to a string and then is
    //parsed back to an object
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(thomas));
